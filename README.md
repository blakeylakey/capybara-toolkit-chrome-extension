# Capybara Toolkit - Chrome Extension

Chrome extension that goes along with the Capybara toolkit app. Made with React.js

## Installation

Enable developer options in chrome and point to the dist folder.

## Status

Big time a work in progress, Amazon's styling is frustrating to work with so most of everything has to be done manually and without a css framework, which is annoying.
