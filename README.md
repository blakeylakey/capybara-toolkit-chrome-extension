## Installation

Enable developer options in chrome and point to the dist folder.

## Status

Work in progress.

Biggest need is for an actually good keyword extractor. The current web app version is RAKE, which sucks. Need to do some research into a good way of extracting keyphrases and ranking keyphrases for amazon listings. Would be nice if I could also get search volume estimates, which would then make it possible to rank keywords on difficulty.

Also needs a product prediction section, for estimated sales, revenue, and profits.

Could use a lot more features presently available on web app version, like the keyword/phrase seasonality, and related keywords. Maybe in the future?
